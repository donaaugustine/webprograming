<h1>Eiffel Tower</h1>
<h3>Eiffel Tower, French Tour Eiffel, Parisian landmark that is also a technological masterpiece 
in building-construction history. When the French government was organizing the 
International Exposition of 1889 to celebrate the centenary of the French Revolution, 
a competition was held for designs for a suitable monument. More than 100 plans were submitted,
 and the Centennial Committee accepted that of the noted bridge engineer Gustave Eiffel. 
Eiffelâ€™s concept of a 300-metre (984-foot) tower built almost entirely of open-lattice wrought 
iron aroused amazement, skepticism, and no little opposition on aesthetic grounds. 
When completed, the tower served as the entrance gateway to the exposition.</h3>
