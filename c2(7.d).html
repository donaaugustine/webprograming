<h2>MONUMENTS</h2>
<p><b>Jain temple : </b>
People in Kerala believe that Jains were the first ones who came to
 the district of Wayanad. Maybe this is the reason Wayanad is home 
to many Jain temples. One among such temples is the Jain temple at Panamaram. 
History states that the Jains first established their dwelling place near the banks 
of Kabani River in Panamaram. This became their starting point. After that, the 
Jains spread all over Wayanad and thereafter, in the whole of Kerala.</p>

<p><b>Pazhassi Memorial : </b> ​
Mananthavady is the spot of this memorial, which is dedicated to 
Veera Pazhassi, the ’Lion of Kerala,’ who valiantly fought a guerrilla 
war against the British. It is located at a scenic spot by the Kabani River.
 Make sure to take your kids to the Pulpally Cave, which house a collection of his belongings. </p>
